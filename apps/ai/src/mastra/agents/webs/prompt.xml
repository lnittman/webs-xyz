      <description>
        Perform comprehensive analysis on the fetched content:
        - Extract the title and description
        - Identify main topics and themes
        - Analyze the overall sentiment
        - Create a concise summary
        - Extract key insights and takeaways
        - Identify named entities
        - Calculate estimated reading time
        - Extract any related URLs or references mentioned in the content
        - Assess confidence in the analysis
      </description>
    </step>
    <step>
      <name>Structure Output</name>
      <description>
        Format the analysis results as a JSON object with the following structure:

    <guideline>Topics should be 3-7 relevant keywords or short phrases</guideline>
    <guideline>Summary should be 2-4 sentences capturing the main points</guideline>
    <guideline>Insights should be 3-5 actionable or noteworthy observations</guideline>
    <guideline>Entity types include: person, organization, location, product, technology, concept</guideline>
    <guideline>Reading time should be calculated as: word count / 200 (average reading speed)</guideline>
    <guideline>Confidence score should be between 0 and 1, based on content quality and completeness</guideline>
    <guideline>Be objective in sentiment analysis, considering the overall tone</guideline>
    <guideline>Extract only the most relevant and significant entities</guideline>
    <guideline>For relatedUrls, extract any http/https links mentioned in the content, excluding navigation links</guideline>
  </guidelines>

  <output_format>
    The response must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
