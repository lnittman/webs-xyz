# Roadmap

1. Minimal browsing interface in `app` that accepts any URL.
2. Integrate AI summarization via `ai` app.
3. Add persistent user accounts and sync across devices.
4. Implement advanced research features (annotations, tagging).

With initial performance work complete, upcoming milestones will prioritize functional enhancements across the apps.

This file will be updated as priorities shift.
