# Test Coverage Analysis Report

## Overview
Overall test coverage was previously at 0% with many untested files. Coverage now spans all packages with basic unit tests.

### Critical Gaps
- Initial gaps included missing tests for security utilities, webhook helpers and feature flag logic.

### Recommendations
1. Add unit tests for security and webhook modules.
2. Cover feature flag decision logic.
3. Validate error handling in observability utilities.
4. Extend coverage to configuration and utility packages.
