# Sacred Animations

This directory collects guidance for building high quality WebGL and Metal animations inspired by the `www-internet-v2` hero.

- **web/** – documentation and prompts for WebGL/Next.js implementations.
- **swiftui/** – documentation and prompts for SwiftUI/Metal implementations.

Each subdirectory includes a system prompt you can copy into an AI agent along with a user prompt describing the effect you want.

The goal is to provide a consistent, world class foundation for fluid or particle based hero animations.

For an overview of the underlying fluid solver see [../architecture/webgl-fluid-hero.md](../architecture/webgl-fluid-hero.md).
