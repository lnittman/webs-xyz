# Implementation Summary: Implement Integration Testing Framework

## Overview
A new integration testing setup was added to improve confidence in interactions between apps. A Vitest configuration was introduced at the repository root along with a sample test verifying the API health endpoint. Documentation now covers how to run and extend integration tests.

## Files Modified
- `package.json` script `integration:test` added
- `vitest.integration.config.ts` new configuration
- `tests/integration/api-health.test.ts` sample test
- `docs/workflows/integration-testing.md` documentation
- `docs/state/development-log.md` new log entry

## Impact
Developers can execute `pnpm integration:test` to run integration tests. This lays groundwork for broader test coverage and reduces regression risk.
