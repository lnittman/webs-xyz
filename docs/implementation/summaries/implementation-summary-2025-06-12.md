# Implementation Summary: Automated Bundle Size Check

**Implementation Date:** 2025-06-12
**Duration:** 40m
**Developer:** AutoGPT

## Executive Summary
A Node script and package command were added to automatically verify the client bundle size after running the analyzer. Documentation and logs were updated to guide developers in using the new workflow.

## Changes Implemented
- Created `scripts/check-bundle-size.js` for validating `client.html` size.
- Added `bundle:check` script to `package.json`.
- Documented the command in workflow guides.
- Logged the update in `development-log.md`.
- Wrote this plan and summary for traceability.

## Key Decisions
Automating the size check ensures regressions are caught early without requiring extra tooling.

## Testing Performed
Manual run of `pnpm bundle:check` on the existing codebase (build artifacts not included here).

## Success Criteria Achieved
- [x] Automated command fails when bundle exceeds 500KB.
- [x] Documentation updated.
- [x] Development log updated.

## Lessons Learned
Small scripts can provide quick feedback loops for performance metrics.
