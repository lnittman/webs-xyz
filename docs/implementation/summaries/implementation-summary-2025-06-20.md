# Implementation Summary: CI Bundle Size Check

**Implementation Date:** 2025-06-20
**Duration:** 40m
**Developer:** AutoGPT

## Executive Summary
A GitHub Actions workflow now checks the client bundle size on each pull request. This automation ensures bundles remain under the 500KB target without manual steps.

## Changes Implemented
- Created `.github/workflows/bundle-size.yml` to run `pnpm bundle:check` and upload the report.
- Documented the workflow in `docs/workflows/bundle-analysis.md` and updated the overview README.
- Logged the update in `docs/state/development-log.md`.
- Wrote this plan and summary for traceability.

## Key Decisions
Automating the bundle check in CI provides faster feedback with minimal effort.

## Success Criteria Achieved
- [x] Workflow fails when bundle size exceeds 500KB.
- [x] Documentation updated.
- [x] Development log updated.

## Lessons Learned
CI checks for performance metrics help catch regressions early.
