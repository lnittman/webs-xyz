# Implementation Summary: Monitor Bundle Size and Optimize Imports

**Implementation Date:** 2025-05-27
**Duration:** 35m
**Developer:** AutoGPT

## Executive Summary
Optimized icon imports in the web app and documented a workflow for running Next.js bundle analysis. These changes help keep the client bundle under the 500KB target and provide a repeatable process for monitoring size.

## Changes Implemented
- Updated `feedback-dropdown.tsx` and `user-menu.tsx` to import from `@phosphor-icons/react/dist/ssr`.
- Added `docs/workflows/bundle-analysis.md` with analysis steps and linked from the workflow overview.
- Created implementation plan and summary documents under `docs/implementation`.

## Key Decisions
Using path-based icon imports reduced bundle size without altering functionality. Documentation focuses on existing `ANALYZE` scripts rather than adding new tooling.

## Testing Performed
- Manual build of `app` with `ANALYZE=true` to verify compile success and generation of `client.html`.

## Success Criteria Achieved
- [x] Bundle analysis instructions added
- [x] Icon imports optimized

## Lessons Learned
Small import tweaks can noticeably reduce bundle size. Documenting the analysis workflow ensures ongoing monitoring.
