# Implementation Summary: Lazy-load BrowserTabsModal

**Implementation Date:** 2025-06-27
**Duration:** 40m
**Developer:** AutoGPT

## Executive Summary
The browser tabs modal used throughout the prompt bar was previously bundled into the main client chunk. Loading it dynamically reduces the initial bundle size and aligns with the bundle optimization recommendation from repo-status-4.

## Changes Implemented
- Replaced the static import of `BrowserTabsModal` with a `next/dynamic` import in `prompt-bar.tsx`.
- Updated `docs/workflows/bundle-analysis.md` with a note about lazy-loading heavy modals.
- Logged the change in `docs/state/development-log.md`.
- Wrote this implementation plan and summary for traceability.

## Key Decisions
Dynamic import was chosen over additional bundler configuration because it keeps the component client-only and yields immediate bundle savings.

## Success Criteria Achieved
- [x] BrowserTabsModal loaded dynamically
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Development log updated

## Lessons Learned
Incremental optimizations like this help maintain performance targets without major refactoring.
