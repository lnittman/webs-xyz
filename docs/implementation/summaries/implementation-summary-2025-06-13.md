# Implementation Summary: Integration Testing Guidelines

**Implementation Date:** 2025-06-13
**Duration:** 25m
**Developer:** AutoGPT

## Executive Summary
A new document now outlines how to set up and run integration tests across the monorepo. This fills a documentation gap highlighted in repo-status-4 and should help developers begin writing cross-app tests.

## Changes Implemented
- Created `docs/testing/integration-guidelines.md` covering setup, running tests, and best practices.
- Logged the update in `docs/state/development-log.md`.
- Wrote the corresponding implementation plan and this summary for traceability.

## Key Decisions
Providing lightweight documentation was chosen over adding new tooling so developers can incrementally build integration tests using existing Vitest setup.

## Success Criteria Achieved
- [x] New guidelines document added
- [x] Development log updated

## Lessons Learned
Documentation gaps can be filled quickly and provide immediate value.
