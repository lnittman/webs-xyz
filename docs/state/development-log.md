# Development Log

## Recent Significant Changes

### 2025-05-21: Added sacred UI components
- **Description**: Merge of pull request #15 introduced new components within design.
- **Components Affected**: design package, app frontend.
- **Architectural Impact**: Expanded UI toolkit for consistent design.
- **Integration Implications**: Frontend now relies on new components; no API changes.
- **Developer Experience Impact**: Improved component reusability.

### 2025-05-18: Updated Next.js to 15.3
- **Description**: All apps upgraded to Next.js 15.3 for stability and feature parity.
- **Components Affected**: app, api, email apps.
- **Architectural Impact**: Updated build and runtime behavior.
- **Integration Implications**: Minor middleware adjustments required.
- **Developer Experience Impact**: Faster local dev with latest features.

## Current Development Trends

### Pattern: Workspace Packages
- Description of emerging pattern: Increasing reliance on shared packages for cross-cutting concerns.
- Where it's being implemented: analytics, auth, design used by all apps.
- Benefits observed: Reduced duplication and improved consistency.
- Potential concerns: Need to maintain version compatibility.

### Technology: Mastra
- Description of technology adoption: AI app uses Mastra for LLM workflows.
- Current implementation locations: apps/ai with Mastra agents.
- Integration with existing systems: API triggers agents over HTTP.
- Effectiveness assessment: Works but lacks scaling features.

## Architectural Evolution

### From Custom Components to Design System
- Description of architectural shift: Migration to unified design components across apps.
- Motivation for change: Consistency and maintainability.
- Implementation progress: Most core pages updated, ongoing expansion.
- Observed benefits and drawbacks: Easier theming but initial migration overhead.

## Tech Debt Initiatives

### Initiative: Improve Testing Coverage
- Description of tech debt being addressed: Limited unit/integration tests across apps.
- Current progress: Setup `@repo/testing` but few tests written.
- Remaining work: Implement tests for critical flows.
- Impact on codebase: Will improve reliability once implemented.

## Feature Development Status

### Feature: AI Summarization
- Current implementation status: Basic agent working via API trigger.
- Design approach: Mastra agent with memory store.
- Implementation challenges: Handling large content and asynchronous processing.
- Integration considerations: Possibly move to queue-based workflow in future.
