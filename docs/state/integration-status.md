# Integration Status Assessment

## Overall Integration Health
- Apps communicate primarily via HTTP and shared packages.
- Integration architecture is relatively straightforward with minimal coupling.
- Shared packages provide consistent utilities and help maintain cohesion.

## App-to-App Integration

### app ↔ api
- **Integration points and mechanisms**: `app` fetches data from `api` via REST/Next.js routes.
- **Data sharing approaches**: JSON responses validated with Zod.
- **Communication patterns**: HTTP requests using fetch and server actions.
- **Integration quality assessment**: Stable; endpoints well-defined.
- **Recent changes or improvements**: Middleware updates to Next.js 15.

### api ↔ ai
- **Integration points and mechanisms**: `api` triggers AI agents via HTTP requests or shared database.
- **Data sharing approaches**: API posts URLs or prompts, AI returns summaries.
- **Communication patterns**: Synchronous calls for summarization; asynchronous webhooks possible.
- **Integration quality assessment**: Basic but functional; could use message queue for scaling.
- **Recent changes or improvements**: None significant.

### api ↔ email
- **Integration points and mechanisms**: `api` uses email templates by importing from `@repo/email` and sending via Resend.
- **Data sharing approaches**: Template props from API events.
- **Communication patterns**: Server-to-server function calls.
- **Integration quality assessment**: Simple and effective.
- **Recent changes or improvements**: Planning more templates for onboarding.

## App-to-Package Integration

### app → design
- **Usage patterns and approach**: All UI built with design components.
- **Customization patterns**: Tailwind classes for variants.
- **Integration effectiveness**: High; ensures consistent UI.
- **Pain points or concerns**: Component coverage still expanding.
- **Recent changes or improvements**: Added sacred components.

### api → database
- **Usage patterns and approach**: Prisma client imported for all DB operations.
- **Customization patterns**: None; uses shared schema.
- **Integration effectiveness**: Good but requires schema updates.
- **Pain points or concerns**: Serverless latency.
- **Recent changes or improvements**: Added new user fields.

## Package-to-Package Integration

### auth → design
- **Dependency relationship**: Auth components styled using design.
- **API consumption patterns**: Re-export of UI components.
- **Coupling assessment**: Low; design optional.
- **Recent changes or improvements**: Theme support enhancements.

### analytics → auth
- **Dependency relationship**: Optional user info from auth when tracking events.
- **API consumption patterns**: AnalyticsProvider uses user session if available.
- **Coupling assessment**: Loose coupling.
- **Recent changes or improvements**: Provider updated for Vercel analytics.

## Integration Pattern Analysis

### Common Patterns
- Workspace packages imported via `workspace:*` protocol.
- Environment variables validated with Zod across packages.
- Next.js and Mastra apps follow similar configuration patterns.

### Anti-Patterns
- Some manual HTTP calls between apps may lack retry logic.
- Limited use of message queues or background jobs.

## Data Flow Mapping
- Users interact with `app` → `app` fetches `api` → `api` triggers `ai` → results stored in database.
- `api` sends emails via `email` templates and notifications via `webhooks`.
- Analytics events captured across apps and sent to PostHog.

## Integration Recommendations
1. Implement message queue for heavy AI tasks
   - **Current State**: `api` performs synchronous calls to AI service.
   - **Target State**: Asynchronous processing via queue and worker.
   - **Suggested Approach**: Use a queue like Upstash or AWS SQS.

2. Expand integration tests across apps
   - **Current State**: Limited manual testing.
   - **Target State**: Automated tests validating API and package interactions.
   - **Suggested Approach**: Use Vitest with `@repo/testing` across apps.

## Recent Integration Changes
- Deprecated packages `storage` and `internationalization` removed from the codebase.
- Updated design components require new props, affecting `app` and `email` templates.
- `app` gained a browser tabs modal component improving navigation between saved pages.
- New API routes `/api/feedback` and `/api/user-settings` handle form submissions
- Database updated with `Feedback` and `UserSettings` models consumed by `api`
