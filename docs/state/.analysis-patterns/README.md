# Analysis Patterns
_Last updated: 2025-06-04_

This directory captures successful approaches and lessons learned from repository analysis efforts.

## Current Patterns
- **Sequential Status Logging**: Maintain a numbered `repo-status-N.md` file for each analysis cycle. Helps track historical context and progress.
- **Component Documentation**: Place detailed app and package documentation under `docs/state/apps` and `docs/state/packages`. Keeps knowledge centralized.
- **Integration Mapping**: Document relationships between apps and packages in `integration-status.md` using Mermaid diagrams for clarity.
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Track repository health over time in `metrics-dashboard.md`.

## Future Improvements
- Automate metric collection via CI scripts.
- Expand pattern library as new challenges arise.
