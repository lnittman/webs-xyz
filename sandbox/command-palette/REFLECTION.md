# Command Palette: Implementation Reflection

## Domain Insights
The design system's sacred components make it easy to maintain a cohesive look and modal behavior. Using them for the command palette ensured immediate consistency with existing UI patterns.

## Architecture Observations
Since the repository already provides a modal context, the palette only needed to register a hotkey and open its modal. No new dependencies were required.

## Integration Considerations
- Wrap the application with `ModalProvider` and include `<ModalStack />`.
- Render `<CommandPalette />` once so the keyboard listener is registered.
- Extend the modal contents with data from the API for dynamic commands.

## Enhancement Value
The palette reduces navigation friction and surfaces hidden pages with a single shortcut, improving user efficiency during research sessions.

## Next Steps
Consider adding search suggestions and history, or exposing configuration for custom command sets.
