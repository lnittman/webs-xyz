# Command Palette: Technical Specification

## Architecture Integration
The feature registers a keyboard listener that opens a modal via the sacred `ModalProvider` system. The modal itself renders design-system command primitives for a familiar look and feel.

## Components and Extensions

### CommandPaletteModal
- **Purpose**: Modal UI containing the command list.
- **Implementation Approach**: Uses `CommandDialog` and related components from `@repo/design-system`.
- **Integration Points**: Opened via `useModals()` so it participates in the global modal stack.

### CommandPalette
- **Purpose**: Registers the hotkey and opens the modal when triggered.
- **Implementation Approach**: Calls `open(CommandPaletteModal)` from `useModals`.
- **Integration Points**: Should be rendered once within a layout wrapped by `ModalProvider`.

## State and Data Flow
The modal relies on internal state for open/close managed by `useModals`. Selected commands push routes via Next.js navigation.

## Integration Strategy
1. Copy the components into a shared package.
2. Wrap your app with `ModalProvider` and include `<ModalStack />`.
3. Render `<CommandPalette />` once at the root.

## Future Considerations
- Fetch commands from an API for dynamic results.
- Add fuzzy search or AI-powered suggestions.
