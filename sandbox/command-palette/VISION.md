# Command Palette: Vision & Rationale

## The Enhancement
The Command Palette introduces a global quick-access menu, enabling users to jump between sections of the app or trigger common actions with a single keyboard shortcut. By building it with the sacred component system, it remains visually consistent with the rest of the interface.

## Discovery Process
While reviewing the codebase, we noticed an existing Command component in the design system that was not yet used in the main app. Pairing it with the sacred modal utilities revealed an opportunity to unify navigation with a familiar pattern often found in productivity tools.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Bookmark Manager
- **Core Idea**: Allow users to save and categorize research links.
- **Potential Value**: Organizes research materials for later reference.
- **Why Not Selected**: Requires database schema changes and more infrastructure than a sandbox demo.

### Alternative 2: AI Session Summaries
- **Core Idea**: Aggregate visited pages into sessions with automatic AI-generated summaries.
- **Potential Value**: Helps users recall key information from research sessions.
- **Why Not Selected**: Depends on expanded AI workflows and data storage not present yet.

## Future Development Opportunities
The palette can evolve to include contextual search, history, and AI-powered suggestions as the application grows.
